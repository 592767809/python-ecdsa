Welcome to python-ecdsa's documentation!
========================================

``ecdsa`` implements
`elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`_,
more specifically the
`Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm>`_
and the
`Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman>`_
algorithms.
Both of those algorithms are used in many protocols in practice, like
in
`TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_
or
`SSH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol>`_.
